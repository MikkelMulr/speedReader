Word Reader

Simply:
enter a block of text into the provided space
select the speed 
click Read

This was made purely out of curiosity after seeing a gif on Twitter
that displayed words one by one at a very rapid pase in order to prove 
that the human eye can still manage to read and understand everything
being displayed. 
<<<<<<< HEAD:README.md

Would like to perhaps add option to change font size and background color to see if that impacts ability to read.
