Word Reader

Simply:
enter a block of text into the provided space
select the speed 
click Read

This was made purely out of curiosity after seeing a gif on Twitter
that displayed words one by one at a very rapid pase in order to prove 
that the human eye can still manage to read and understand everything
being displayed. 

Would like to perhaps add option to change font size and background color to see if that impacts ability to read.
